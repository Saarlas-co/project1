# Project 1
Project 1 tests my skills in creating a fully functional user sign-up form, as well as my ability to design an engaging web page that captures and retains the user's attention.

My sign-up sheet will be for a beta test of a new fictitious operating system, AuroraOS: a context-aware operating system that adapts its user interface and functionalities based on the context of use (e.g., work, personal, gaming). 
It uses machine learning to understand user habits and preferences, dynamically adjusting settings, notifications, and app recommendations to fit the current context. 

The goal of this project is to experiment with patterns of interaction that ultimately persuade the user to sign up for the beta test.

This project will explore various HTML elements and attributes, exciting uses of CSS (color palettes, styles, design), and necessary javascript to bring functionality to my website.
